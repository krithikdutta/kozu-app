# My First Blog Post

I’m reviving my portfolio, and the goal isn't perfection—it's progress.

I realized I needed two things in my life right now:

- A forcing function to write. I want to maintain a learning journal to document my growth and solidify concepts.

- A laboratory. I need a safe place to experiment with AI agents and virtual assistants without the pressure of a production environment.


So, I mentioned that I’m rebooting this site to get my hands dirty with new tech and get back into writing. But what does that actually look like?

I didn't want this to be just a static resume. I wanted it to be living, breathing, and actually useful. Here is the quick tour of the three main zones I’ve built (so far).

### 1. The Chatbot (My "Digital Twin")
This is probably the part I’m most excited about. If you look at [Home](https://krru.dev/#chat), you’ll see a chat interface.

That isn't a customer support script. It’s a custom-built AI that I’ve trained on my own context—my resume, my past projects, and my professional history.

**Why I built it:**
* **To learn:** This was my way of diving deep into Agentic RAG systems.
* **For you:** You can ask it anything (hopefully soon). "What is Krithik's experience with Python?" or "Tell me about a recent project." It saves you from digging through a PDF resume and gives you immediate answers.

### 2. The Resources Page (The "Library")
I consume a lot of content—articles, videos, docs, and tutorials. Usually, I read them, close the tab, and lose them forever.

The **Resources** page is my attempt to stop the information leak. It’s a curated list of everything I’m finding valuable right now. If I bookmark it there, it means it’s high-signal stuff that helped me solve a problem or think differently.

If you’re looking for cool content without the noise, check that page out.

### 3. The Blog (The "Learning Journal")
And finally, right here—the **Blog**.

This isn't going to be a place for polished, ghostwritten thought leadership pieces. This is my "learning journal." It’s where I document the messy process of engineering. You’ll see posts about:

* Why I chose a specific tech stack (and if I regret it).
* Frontier technology I’m experimenting with.
* Retrospectives on projects.

### The Goal:
I’m building this site in public. I hope you poke around, ask the bot some tough questions, and maybe find a useful link in the resources.

Let me know what you think!
